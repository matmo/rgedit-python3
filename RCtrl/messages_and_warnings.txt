New in version 0.7.0.5:
1) Messages and warnings concerning new releases can be displayed here, unless disabled from the Configure R Interface dialog (they can be found in the /RCtrl/messages_and_warnings.txt file);
2) In the R console, <Ctrl>C now *copies the current selection* instead of stopping the current operation, action taken over by <ESC> and <Ctrl>Q (to change these settings and revert to the default behaviour, please visit the Configure R Interface -> Edit keyboard shortcuts);
3) Also in the R console, <Ctrl>K copies the last executed line to the clipboard, and <Ctrl><Shift>K also pastes it in the current gedit tab.

New in version 0.7.0.6:
1) rgedit-specific toolbar and sidebar can be shown only for R source files (toggle using the Show/hide toolbat -> Show toolbar only for R files)
